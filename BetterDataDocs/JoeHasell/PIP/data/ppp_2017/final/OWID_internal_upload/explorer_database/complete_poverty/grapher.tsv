	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_100	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

	40% of median - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income or expenditure. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	3;6;9;12;15;18;21	true	YlOrBr

	$1 a day - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_100	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

	40% of median - poverty gap index	poverty_gap_index_40_median	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median expenditure. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	3;6;9;12;15;18;21	true	YlOrBr

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)	%	%	5.0	Numeric	0.0	10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	true	RdPu

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income or expenditure. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.  It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.
