	Mean Log Deviation	mld	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of inequality. An MLD of zero indicates perfect equality and it takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal. The measure is also referred to as 'Theil L' or 'GE(0)', in reference to the wider families of inequality measures to which the MLD belongs.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)			5.0	Numeric	0.0	0;0.1;0.2;0.3;0.4;0.5;0.6;0.7;0.8;0.9;1	true	RdPu
	Polarization index	polarization	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform	The polarization index, also known as the Wolfson polarization index, measures the extent to which the distribution of expenditure is “spread out” and bi-modal. Like the Gini coefficient, the polarization index ranges from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (complete polarization). The polarization index is based on Wolfson (1994) and Ravallion and Chen (1997). See Wolfson, Michael C. 1994. “When Inequalities Diverge.” The American Economic Review 84 (2): 353–58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117858 and Ravallion, Martin, and Shaohua Chen. 1997. “What Can New Survey Data Tell Us about Recent Changes in Distribution and Poverty?” The World Bank Economic Review 11 (2): 357–82. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3990232.	https://pip.worldbank.org/	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)			5.0	Numeric	0.0	0;0.1;0.2;0.3;0.4;0.5;0.6;0.7	true	Reds
