## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import os
os.cpu_count()
print("THIS IS NEW")
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
chi' = sum_{i=1} s_i^2
$$
