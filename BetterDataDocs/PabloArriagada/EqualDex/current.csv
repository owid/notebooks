""In giving a liberal and purposive interpretation to section 14(3) of the Constitution the reference to “sex” ought not to merely reference a physical gender. Such an approach would be too linear and restrictive. The reference to “sex” would necessarily encompass concepts such as gender identity, sexual character, and sexual orientation. It would be self-defeating to the constitutional provision if the notion of sex were to be separated from matters of sexual orientation and sexual identification since the concept of sex as a physical gender carries with it a perception of how people identify and are oriented even in those instances when the identification and orientation are stereotypical or traditional in nature.""",

<br />
1. When being asked if members of the LGBTQIA+ community can serve in the Indonesian Military, here are their response: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950706476623933446) <br />
Ooohhh, cannot (shocked face)<br />
<br />
Upon selection there are psychological tests, LGBT is a mental disorder. If there are many recruits that are mentally healthy why must we accept the mentally deficient?<br />
<br />
2. The twitter went viral and there were some criticisms, which they responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950723833606037505)<br />
(The word “normal” means heterosexual)<br />
Responding to many mentions that went in -> until right now there are still many Military recruits that have a normal sexual orientation. <br />
<br />
Members of the Indonesian Military are governed by military norms including religious norms & laws, so (members) must be physically & mentally healthy<br />
<br />
3. In response to the numerous tweets arguing that homosexuality is not a mental illness, they responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950733029894381569)<br />
(“Airmin” is how they say Air Force Admin)<br />
(“UI” is short for the University of Indonesia, the top University in Indonesia)<br />

4. One person replied that it is an opinion of one person and does not equate the scientific burden of proof. They responded with: (https://twitter.com/_TNIAU/status/950737066127536128)<br />
As an member of the Military who is pious to the Almighty God and as a Muslim the Al-Quran is enough to be a scientific proof, are there any higher knowledge and more credible than the Holy Bible? In the Holy Bible LGBT is not only prohibited but also “cursed”<br />
